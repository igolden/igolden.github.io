title: Week 3 Recap - HFR 
---

Week 3 of the year is over, and business/life has happened as always. Sick past couple days, wrapping up a few projects, kicking off a few new ones. Sometimes fitness can't be the first focus. But staying up to 80% consitency keeps me on track.

###Training

Was quick and focused with workouts this week. Was more concerned about getting in/out than getting the most out of my time, though.

###Nutrition

Relaxed on nutrition, really due to schedule. It could've been better but stayed on track with choices and portions overall.

###Supplements

Decent on vitamins, whey.

###Water

Only hit water 3 times.

Plenty of sleep to recover this week.
