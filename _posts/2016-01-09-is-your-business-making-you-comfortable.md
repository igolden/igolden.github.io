title: Is Your Business Making Your Comfortable? 
---

Yesterday morning was one for the books. Besides getting woke up with calls from the East Coast around 6AM, it was actually a great morning. I was able ot catch up on client work and find some clarity to my plan for my businesses in 2016.

That's when I realized that sometimes, the business you are running can make you *comfortable*, which leads to being *complacent*.

I think we all fall into patterns of monotony, and just doing well enough. For me, even when I'm in a phase like this with my web development company, I'm always excited about some other area in my life or work. The challenge is to create excitement in the driver of you income, your business, at all times.

> So how can we prevent the comfort trap? 

For me, it's constantly changing and improving. Over the last year, I've been in "preparation" for scaling up my business ot a new level. Even though we've experience significant growth each year since starting, it's time to build out a company that I'm proud'er' of.

Do you get excited when people ask you what you do? When you tell people about your business are they confused? Are you confused? Then it might be time to take a look at what you're doing and find a way to make it **exciting** again or **more clear** so that others can be excited too.

For me, it's always exciting to offer new services and find new clients. So that's what I do when I get comfortable.
