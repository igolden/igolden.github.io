title: Three Ideas that Shaped My Views on Growing as a Developer
---

This website will serve as a platform for me to speak and develop my *personal* ideas, opinions, and methodologies surrounding business and technology development. Over the next 5 years I'm going to make a very concious effort to grow in all aspects as both an entrepreneur and a web developer.

-----

That being said I invite dialogue and conversation about my ideas, opinions, and methodologies. I belive strongly that ideas need to be evaluated and discussed by multiple minds in order to truly reach a higher level of intelligence. 

Below are some of my personal idealogies when looking at technology and the world:

* Everyone is an artist, learn like one.
* Time is the most valuable asset to any developer or entrepreneur. 
* Use the right tools, even if you're less experienced. 

A quick overview of these ideas, but more will come.


**Learn like an artist** - As a developer, all of your skills are infinitely rich. You will never reach a point of infinite knowledge in which you can no longer expand upon. It's like playing guitar, no one will ever reach a point of total, absolute knowledge of guitar. *It's an artform.*

So what does that do to my attitude as I'm learning? *It keeps me humble.* It's important to remember you are constantly a life-long learner and you need to find new knowledge in all your conversations about code. Be an artist and use your tools to create new results, that will in turn, teach you more about your toolset.

**Time is Incredibly Valuable** - The most important thing we can do to grow personally as web developers or entrepreneurs is find ways to become more efficient. This can be easier for some in life, and others in programming. For me personally, Vim is the holy grail of efficiency when programming. You can create aliases to save your time immediately and map common functions to cut your keystrokes in half. 

So how do I make choices surrounding my time usage? First, I *take my time seriously*. You can't treat your time like a college kid does, otherwise you'll get amateur results. Create an aggressive schedule. Then start tracking your time and activitites. Identify keystroke combinations you are overusing. Use your text editor to eliminate those tasks. Reciprocate these ideas to your schedule and marketing tasks.

**Tools over Tradition** - I want people to value the tools in front of them more then they value their current experience. When you begin to use multiple tools and languages, you will become more versatile as a programmer. Not being bound to any particular language will allow you to think creatively and model your objects more accurately, without the constraints of a particular toolset. 

The fact is, flip phones were new technology 10 years ago. We have no idea what technology we will be developing 20 years from now. If you're a young developer like I am, then you need to be concious and accepting of new tools, not critical and closeminded.

So when I am scouring Youtube for content to absorb, I let my mind wander. I watch videos on languages that aren't a particular focus of mine. I also always evaluate the industry standard tools for a particular job, before I start. I don't just dive into my favorite toolset to begin a job ---which is okay--- I think through who I want to work with and understand the specialized tools for the job.

Hope you're looking forward to hearing more about these ideas.

Thanks!
