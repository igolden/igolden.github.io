I use Hyper.sh when I'm using react. React comes with a shitload of dependencies to run...

xcode, rnpm, debugger, redux debugger, text editor, etc.

Well one annoying thing is the "primary window" on iTerm. If I have 4 iTerm windows open, 
if I click into the one with my vim instances it doesn't always know that's the one I want.

It usually defaults to the last/first open, or whatever it feels like. It's a little 
wonky frankly.
