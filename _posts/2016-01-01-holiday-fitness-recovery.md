title: Holiday Fitness Recovery Plan 
---

Let's face it, the holidays are a time for relaxing and enjoying the company of friends and family. That, however, doesn't really go hand in hand with being in sick shape.

So the holidays are over, and it's time to get back on track.

> ###But Ian, why? What are you training for?

I'm training for life - and I'm sick of getting asked that. I don't need a reason to be in great shape, that's a ***requirement of success*** to me. Plus being in shape and eating right makes *every other* aspect of your life easier.

---

So here's the plan
---

Over the next 30 days I'm going to exercise some serious discipline on my diet, training, and sleep to get things moving in the right direction. Luckily, I've been on and off of fitness for the last 6 years, so I can put together a training/nutrition schedule that will work for me.

**I'll be focusing on the following areas:**

* Training Split
* Nutrition (tracked by macros)
* Water
* Sleep
* Vitamins/Supplementation

---

Each one, in more detail.

###Training Split

<table>
<thead>
<th>Day</th>
<th>Training</th>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Friday</td>
<td>Back, Biceps, Traps</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Saturday</td>
<td>Chest, Triceps, Shoulders, Abs/Calves</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sunday</td>
<td>Big Legs - Squats, Deadlifts, Lunges (quad focus)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Monday</td>
<td>HIIT Cardio - Lightweight Cardio Lift</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tuesday</td>
<td>Full Upper Body Volume Day</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wednesday</td>
<td>Hamstring Focus Leg Day</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Thursday</td>
<td>HIIT Cardio</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
Each day, there is some training involved. I'd also like get some 'bonus' lifts in each morning. 100x pushups, 100x Pullups, 100x ab wheels, 100x barbell curls. Luckily I have access to all of that in my house.

###Nutrition

Ah... I love nutrition. But for an ectomorph, nutrition is one of the biggest commitments I have to make when getting focused on my fitness. It's 6 meals a day, track them all in [Myfitnesspal](http://myfitnesspal.com), and absolutely 0 alcohol. It's just what you ***have to do*** when you're a hard gainer.

---


###Water

Water -- That's your **life force**. Easily one of the biggest differences for your skin, sleep, and overall energy is drinking lots of water everyday. And I mean a lot. I'm putting back 1-2 gallons a day habitually during this Holiday Recovery, but I do this close to year round.


---


###Sleep

Sleep... zzzz... Constantly overlooked. And as an entrepreneur, I personally abuse my sleeping habits. Fitness helps to create that stability for me. I need about 6 hours minimum a night to grow, so I have to get on a consistent schedule this month.

###Vitamins/Supplementation

Vitamins and supplementation are just the final 2%. I know a lot of people who LOVE preworkout, creatine, etc etc. All of that is useless if you're not hitting everything else above. For a detailed view of my vitamin stack [see this post.](https://www.instagram.com/p/8gA53JFwKj/?taken-by=igoldenfit) For supplements, I take whey protein before and after the gym, with about 5g of creatine daily (very little). I take BCAA's with me in my water jug daily as well, but that's it.

###Goal Setting

My main goal is to set myself up for another year of growth in fitness. In the picture below you'll see my current conditioning, about 1 mo off training/diet, and left is when I was well conditioned before I bulked in 2015. My goal is to prepare myself to be back in that conditioning, and get as close possible to it, by the end of January.

###Conclusion

I'll be posting weekly updates here until it's done. Time to get shreddy!
