title: K-IDs BMV
year: 2015
image_slug: kidsbmv
lead: Interactive ID builder with formatted exports, payments, and vendors.
details: Solved unique workflow problems in product fufillment. K-IDS BMV collects personal identity information from parents, about their kids, and prints a safe child ID card with their allergies and doctor information. I built a secure, performant online tool for selling their product online, and completely automated the export process so they could print their IDs in bulk. I was the sole developer for two iterations of this product.
