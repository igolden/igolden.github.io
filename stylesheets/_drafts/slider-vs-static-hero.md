title: Slider vs. Static Hero
---

One of the most valuable pieces of real estate on your website is the homepage hero area. Many people refer to the hero as, "hero image", but in this instance hero refers to the same commanding area a hero image would be placed. 

###Why is it so important?
When a user gets to your website, you need to identify with them. This can be done through either text, visuals, or audio. So to create a priority and give the user some structure, you need to have certain elements command space on your webpage.

For instance - you wouldn't try and communicate the deadline of an event on your website, by sneaking it in the paragraph would you? No, you would but the date righ tup fornt and visible so that no one misses the event. It's the same concept for user identfication. You need to give them the gratest first experience you can in the hero, through a mix of visual and textual content (audio if you're using a video).

###Static vs Moving
Now that we've defined the goals behind our hero, we can actually use logic to determine whether a static image hero and a slider would be more effective. How does a sliding image effect the senses? Will that be too overpowering?

Ultimately, if you're the designer and you have the say, your opinion is where you should trust you gut. But if you are thinking about building a website that is *sales-driven*, you need to think about what would be more effective at engaging the user.

As a rule of thumb, use these are you're making our decisions:

**Static Sliders** - Static sliders are great for websites with a singular focus. You don't need to stack multiple ideas into the hero area, instead you want to push the user to scroll down or click a button.

**Sliders** - Sliders clearly have a more dynamic and flexible functionality kit to them. With the right images you can tell the user a story or demo a product. But besides that, the main function of a slider is to hold multiple ideas. If I am building a multi page website with many sub-pages, I can guarantee you the homepage has a slider or very clear category navigation.


This was just a quick post to discuss the logic behind choosing a moving or static hero image. If I have to communicate a singular idea, I almost always use a static image hero. However, the hero is important enough to consider adding dynamic functionality to, regardless of the slider.
