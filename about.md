title: About me

Want technical feedback on your ideas or startup? Inbox me about coffee. 

Since 2006, I've been building websites, writing software, and helping companies be successful through technology. I'm currently the **VP of Engineering at Bowtie**, a software development consultancy in Denver, Colorado. 

My background in technology has always been focused on generating revenue from software, for both clients and personal pursuits. That has always given me a unique perspective of the software engineering lifecycle, and the tradeoffs between technical priorities and business priorities. I am one of the rare few who can communicate not just effectively, but passionately, with both C-Suite executives and software developers about solving meaningful problems.

I'm personally excited about the rapidly changing world of iOS, APIS, and AWS. I'd love to talk about scaling your product, or any of the opportunities those technologies can offer your.
