title: "Exit Code 127"
---

Recently was running docker containers, and was trying to curl a tar file to unpack a binary.

Ran into the error:

```
returned a non-zero code: 127
```

If you're getting this code, you probably are calling a command that's not globally available. In my case, I was calling wget/curl -- both weren't installed on the docker image yet. 

Just a quick note to self - non-zero code 127 means **check your dependencies**.
