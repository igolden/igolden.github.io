title: Week 1 Recap - HFR 
---

A week has passed of consistent nutrition and dieting. Overall, it feels great to be back on a consistent training schedule and meal plan. I think it really brings structure to my life as an entrepreneur.

There's something to be said for creating a plan, executing it, and learning from it. It gives you a sense of self confidence that you don't have to compromise with yourself and your goals. It's fun to compete against yourself and win.

*If you can win against yourself everyday, you can conquer anything.*


However, this past week was just like any week when I'm getting in rhythm. I excelled in some areas, and could improve in others. Here's a look at how I scored myself this past week:

> **Why am I giving myself a score for the week?** - It's important to track your performance on a scale for improvement. You have to find little ways to get better and improve yourself, raising the bar for a '10'.

###Training

This was a good week for training. Didn't miss any days, but I didn't train at a consistent time with nutrition planned for each session. I could've improved my training with week with better preparation and planning.

###Nutrition

It was a good week getting back on nutrition. Stayed at 5-6 meals daily, and incorporated whey back into my diet before/after my workout.

Could've been a 10/10 if I weighed things out and tracked them in MFP.

###Supplements

I didnt' stay consistent with my vitamins, whey, or BCAA's. Hit about 50%. This week, I'm working back in 5g of creatine a day with my water. So there's a lot of room for improvement here.

###Water

Killed water all week. Included BCAA's most days, but stayed over a gallon consistently. That's a 10/10.

###Sleep

Was up past 2am 4 out of 7 nights. Not the right way to grow muscle. Going to get my sleep schedule back on track this next week.

##The Results

Sitting around 178-180. My mind to muscle connection is coming back to life, and I feel good. In the time difference I trained my all my muscle groups twice, and I can see how its affected my body.

Time to keep rollin.

See you in a week.
