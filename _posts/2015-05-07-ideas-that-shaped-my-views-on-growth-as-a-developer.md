title: Three Ideas that Shaped My Views
---

This website will serve as a platform for me to speak and develop my *personal* ideas, opinions, and methodologies surrounding business and technology development. Over the next 5 years I'm going to make a very concious effort to grow in all aspects as both an entrepreneur and a web developer.

-----

That being said I invite dialogue and conversation about my ideas, opinions, and methodologies. I belive strongly that ideas need to be evaluated and discussed by multiple minds in order to truly reach a higher level of intelligence. 

Below are some of my personal idealogies when looking at technology and the world:

* Everyone is an artist.
* Time is the most valuable asset to a developer or entrepreneur. 
* Tools over tradition, everytime. 

A quick overview of these ideas, but more will come.


**Everyone is an artist** - As a developer, all of your skills are infinitely rich. You will never reach a point of infinite knowledge in which you can quit expanding upon. It's like playing guitar, no one will ever reach a point of hearing nothing new on the guitar. 

So what does that do to my attitude as I'm learning? *It keeps me humble.* It's important to remember you are constantly a life-long learner and you need to find knowledge in all your conversations about code. Learn from yourself if you're teaching novices.

**Time is Valuable** - The most important thing we can do to grow personally as web developers or entrepreneurs is find ways to become more efficient. This can be easier for some in life, and others in programming. For me personally, Vim is the holy grail of efficiency when programming. You can create aliases to save your time immediately and map common functions to cut you keystrokes in half. 

So how do I make choices surrounding my time usage? First, I *take my time seriously*. You can't treat your time like a college kid does, otherwise you'll get amateur results. Create an aggressive schedule. Then start tracking your time and activitites. Identify keystroke combinations you are overusing. Use your text editor to eliminate those tasks. Reciprocate these ideas to your schedule and marketing tasks.

**Tools over Tradition** - I want people to value the tools in front of them more then they value their current experience. When you begin to use multiple tools and become more versatile. The fact is, flip phones were a hit 10 years ago. We have no idea what technology we will be developing 20 years from now. If you're a young developer like I am, then you need to be concious and accepting of new tools, not critical and closeminded.

So when I am scouring Youtube for content to absorb, I let my mind wander. I watch videos on languages that aren't a particular focus of mine. I also always evaluate the industry standard tools for a particular job, before I start. I don't just dive into my favorite toolset to begin a job ---which is okay--- I think through who I want to work with and understand the specialized tools for the job.

Hope you're looking forward to hearing more about these ideas.

Thanks!
