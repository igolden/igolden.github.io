###Training

This week I was able to get past the full body of soreness. After the first couple of weeks, my body starts to recover much faster, and I can feel the change happening.

###Nutrition

Overall, the nutrition was great again. Didnt' track things to the exact macro, but stayed at 6 total meals a day and got creative with some of them. Also incorporated more fibrous carbs this week.


---

###Supplements

Didn't stay consistent with vitamins, but started adding 5g of creatine to my water each day, along with BCAA's.

###Water

Gallon + a day.

###Sleep

Managed to get around 6 hrs of sleep every night. Could've been better if I made it consistent hours.

##The Results

Weight is flucuating between 176-178. Once during this week I was able get up to 180 again, but I has just smashed a protein shake so I will chuck that one up to liquid weight.

I can see changes in my abs, which I've been working habitually each week.

> The body is like a block of clay. To start working with it, you have to warm it up. Once it's warmed up you can mold it into whatever physique you choose.

Finally getting back in the swing of rapid fitness progress. It's only getting easier.

See you at the end of week 3.
