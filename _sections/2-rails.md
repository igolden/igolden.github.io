title: Ruby
lead: A fantastic language for the web, and an underrated language for power scripting. 
details: Most people see Ruby and Rails as one and the same. Even more, most developers see Ruby as a tool for the web, but it's so much more. Since 2012, I've been using Ruby for web development, automation, research, and fun.
