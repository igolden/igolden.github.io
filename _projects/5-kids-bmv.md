title: K-IDs BMV
lead: Interactive ID builder with formatted exports, payments, and vendors.
details: Solved unique workflow problems for K-IDS BMV. At events, K-IDS BMV collect identity information from parents to print a child ID card. I built a secure, performant online tool for selling and printing these IDs. A core concept was the export to Windows ID printing software.
