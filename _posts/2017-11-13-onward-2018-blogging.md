It's been awhile since I've posted something on the blog, and I've wanted to fix that. I took some time to reflect on the purpose of this blog and what I'd like it to do. This post details my plans with it moving forward.

This blog and website have always had the purpose of representing me and what I'm working on in technology. While it displays my experience clearly on the homepage, it falls far short of keeping the picture accurate and up to date.

A large part of my free time is gathering research across a wide variety of technology topics. Scattered across a dozen or more areas, I literally have notepads full of potential app implementations, source code reviews, tool evaluations. From esoteric unix tricks to meaningful patterns and practices, it's there when I need it. Regardless, I wish I would've posted that research when I wrote it down, rather than leave it on paper where it's not programatically accessible. 

So moving forward, it's my intention to post all of my research to this blog and have it serve as the public repository for things I'm learning. Right now that list consists of:

**Programming Languages**

- C++
- Go

**Game Engines**

- UE4
- Unity

**Digital Art/GUIs**

- Blender
- Meshlab
- Zbrush

Of course, I'm using ruby/js/vim/bash daily. All of my projects are deployed to AWS. So new research in those areas will always be included.

This post makes it official. Look forward to knowledge!
