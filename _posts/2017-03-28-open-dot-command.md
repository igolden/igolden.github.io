Open Files from Terminal with 'open .'
===

One command I've found myself using a ton, and saving time with it, is the `open` command in iTerm. This command is available in all terminals and operating systems with a desktop.

OK - scenario:

I'm working in Vim on a project and that project is located in my general projects dir, `/code`.
