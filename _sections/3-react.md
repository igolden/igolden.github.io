title: Javascript
lead: The king of the browser, and much more. I use javascript for more of my clients. 
details: Javascript has completely changed since 2015. It truly is the language of the web, but now it's become the pinnacle of cross-platform support. I love using javascript for hacking the browser, AWS lambdas, and interactive clis.
