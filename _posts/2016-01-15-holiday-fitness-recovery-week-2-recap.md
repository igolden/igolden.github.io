###Training

This week I was able to get past full body soreness, which happens when returning from a short time off. After these first couple of weeks, my body will start to recover much faster. I can feel this change happening.

###Nutrition

My nutrition is absolutely bulletproof right now. Didn't track things to the exact macro, but stayed at 6 total meals a day and got creative with some of my prep. Also incorporated more fibrous carbs this week.


---

###Supplements

Didn't stay consistent with vitamins, but started adding 5g of creatine to my water each day, along with BCAA's.

###Water

Gallon + a day.

###Sleep

Managed to score about 6 hrs of sleep every night. Could've been better if I made it consistent hours.

##The Results

Weight is flucuating between 176-178. Once during this week I was able get up to 180 again, but I has just smashed a protein shake so I will chuck that one up to liquid weight.

I can see changes in my abs, which I've been working habitually each week.

> The body is like a block of clay. To start working with it, you have to warm it up. Once it's warmed up you can mold it into whatever physique you choose.

Finally getting back in the swing of rapid fitness progress. It's only getting easier.

See you at the end of week 3.
