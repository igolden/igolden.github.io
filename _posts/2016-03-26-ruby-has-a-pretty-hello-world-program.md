title: Ruby has a pretty Hello World program

As I've begun studying C++ and other systems languages, I've begun to appreciate ruby for it's beauty. Learning ruby as a first lang has always been a slight regret of mine, mainly because I lived in the "sauce" of ruby for too long. Instead of approaching problems at the lowest level possible (closer to ultimate truth), I was usually in some high-level abstraction in Rails.

One thing that I find just darn pretty is the Hello World comparison between the two. Obviously, this is just a syntax comparison, but dang! If this were about performance we wouldn't even be talking about Ruby.

Hello world in C++: 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
  std::cout << "Hello World!";
}
```

and in Ruby:

```
p "Hello World!"
```
