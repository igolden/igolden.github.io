Mac OSX Keybinding
===

I want to talk about a few key keybindings I use.

1. Remap Caps-Lock => Ctrl

If you use vim or the terminal frequently in development, then you'll love this keymapping. Let's face it, no one really needs the caps-lock key anyways. It's just fluff. But the awkward placement of Ctrl (a critical key in the terminal) makes the remap valuable.


2. Remap Shift_r (right shift) => Backspace

One a 15" computer the delete and escape keys are one of the biggest stretches. I have bad wrists, so reducing that distance is key to me. This is my newest key mapping, but fastly becoming one of my favorites for ergonomics.


3. CMD + (1-0) => Space

I've mapped CMD + 1-0 keys to individual mission control screens. I put specific applications in each, so it's an easy jump. I find this as a lot better choice then CMD+TAB
